## Day 21

### Implementing the project to a local Wordpress environment

Set up a local XAMPP server for PHP and Wordpress to start the implementation process. Currently I am turning the made project into a custom theme for wordpress.

## Day 22

### Fixed broken spots in SASS, JS, webpack.config.js and wordpress files

Fixed a missed class change in accordion related JS files (active class for opening the accordion panel). Fixed webpack compiling, so running ***npm run build*** will compile bundle.js and main.css respectively and CSS is not mixed into bundle.js anymore.

## Day 23

### Created custom post type (and unfinished taxonomy)

Currently trying to make accordion content modifiable in the wordpress environment. Created Events custom post type and started on custom taxonomies.
